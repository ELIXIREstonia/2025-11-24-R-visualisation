# 2024-10-09-R-visualisation

ELIXIR-EE training course on R, Rstudio and ggplot2 graphical grammar. Target to learners who have some experience with R and Rstudio and would like to learn the art of creating captivating images with ggplot2.

The main document of the lecture is the [2024-10-09-R-visualisation.Rmd](2024-10-09-R-visualisation.Rmd) R markdown document. R markdown allows code (examples) and explanation / documentation to be in the same document in a nicely formatted, well structured manner.

Data files needed in the code are located in the `data` folder.

Learning outcomes for the training:

1.  **Apply Data Wrangling Techniques**:

-   Students will be able to manipulate and transform data using the tidyverse packages (`dplyr`, `readr`, etc.), including filtering, grouping, summarizing, and mutating datasets to prepare them for analysis.

2.  **Implement ggplot2 for Data Visualization**:

-   Students will be able to construct complex and multi-layered visualizations using `ggplot2`, applying the principles of the Grammar of Graphics to create informative and aesthetically pleasing plots.

3.  **Enhance Data Visualizations with Aesthetic Mapping**:

-   Students will be able to effectively map variables to various aesthetic properties in `ggplot2` plots, such as color, size, shape, and transparency, to add depth and clarity to their visualizations.

4.  **Customize Plot Themes and Export High-Quality Graphics**:

-   Students will be able to customize `ggplot2` themes, titles, axis labels, and other non-data elements to enhance plot readability and professionalism, as well as export plots to various formats using **`ggsave`**.

5.  **Combine Multiple Plots Using Patchwork**:

-   Students will be able to use the patchwork package to combine multiple `ggplot2` plots into a cohesive and organized layout, facilitating comprehensive data storytelling and comparative analysis.

This is the second part of a two-part curriculum designed to introduce R and ggplot2. If you are unfamiliar with the basic syntax, data types, and the tidyverse in R, then you should first check out Part One at: <https://github.com/ELIXIREstonia/2024-10-02-R-basic>.
